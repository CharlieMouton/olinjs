# Lesson 2 In-Class Exercises
(As before, weâ€™re not expecting you to finish all of these activities! Pick the ones which are interesting and challenging to you, and feel free to work with the people around you.)

## JavaScript Concepts:
- Break into groups of ~4 members. Each member is in charge of finding out about a specific javascript concept and writing a small jsfiddle that demonstrates it
  - Comeback together and give quick whiteboard talks about your concepts
  - Concepts:
    - First-Class and Higher Order Functions
    - Prototypes/Inheritance
	- Bind, Apply, Call
    - Closures

## Event Listeners:
- Much of Web development is learning to react to event, as first foray into this write a small codepen [like this](http://codepen.io/jagreene/pen/pjMRvb) that creates a simple html element and responds to an event of your choice.

## Functional Programming:
- Part of the power of JavaScript is that is supports imperative (like C), object oriented (like C++ or Java), and functional (like Fortran or Lisp) programming paradigms. Its likely you've run into the first two through sofdes, so if you are new to functional programming now is a great time to get an introduction
- Read one or more of the following (in order of read time):
  - [A Practical Introduciton To Functional Programming](https://medium.com/@riteshkeswani/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming-javascript-ba5bee2369c2#.z4n0g8oew)
  - [Introduction to Functional Javascript](https://medium.com/functional-javascript/introduction-to-functional-javascript-45a9dca6c64a#.nq16t3bdp)
  - [Eloquent Javascript 1st Ed Ch 6: Functional Programming](http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/chapter6.html)
- Use what you learned (do some of the following):
  - Discuss what you learned with a partener
  - Write a two small jsfiddles that do a simple task, one in an object oriented fashion, the other in a functional one.
  - Write a jsfiddle that uses JavaScripts functional tools like map() and reduce()
